# Uncommon Dart Bug: Fragile JSON Data Access and Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked bug in Dart applications dealing with asynchronous network operations and JSON data parsing.  The `bug.dart` file showcases code vulnerable to unexpected JSON structures and lacking robust error handling. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides improved error handling, null safety, and more reliable JSON data access.

**Problem:**

The original code directly accesses a JSON field assuming a specific structure, leading to potential crashes if the API response changes unexpectedly.  Furthermore, the error handling is simplistic, missing opportunities for retries and more informative error messages.

**Solution:**

The solution introduces improved practices such as:

- **Type safety:** Explicit type checking during JSON decoding.
- **Null safety:** Handling potential `null` values safely.
- **Robust error handling:** Implementing proper error handling and retry logic for transient network issues.
- **Clearer error messages:** Providing more specific information for debugging.

This example underscores the importance of defensive programming and proactive error handling when interacting with external APIs.
